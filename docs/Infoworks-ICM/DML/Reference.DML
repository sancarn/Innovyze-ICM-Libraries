            `#### Description:
                
                
                Displays a file dialog (open or save), and if OK is selected returns the
                file path, or if allow\_multiple\_files was set to true, an array of
                selected files.
                
                The parameters are as follows:
                
                open – true if the dialog is to be an 'open' dialog (i.e. to select an
                existing file to be read subsequently in the Ruby script), false if it
                is to be a 'save' dialog (i.e. to select the name of a file to be
                written subsequently in the Ruby script)
                
                extension – the extension of the file e.g. 'csv', 'dat', 'xml'.
                
                Description – a description of the type of file to save which will
                appear in the file dialog e.g. 'Comma Separated Value file'.
                
                Default name – a default name to save the file (if open is false), or a
                default name to search for (if open is true).
                
                Allow multiple files – true if open is false and you wish to allow more
                than one file to be selected. The parameter is ignored if open is true.
                
                The method returns the path of the file chosen as a string, unless open
                is true and allow\_multiple\_files is true, in which case an array of
                strings is returned.
                
                Hard-wire cancel – if this parameter is true or nil, if the user cancels
                from the dialog, the execution of the Ruby script is stopped.

                string.
                
                The parameters are as follows:
                
                Title – a title for the dialog
                
                Hard-wire cancel – if the parameter is true or nil, if the user cancels
                from the dialog, the execution of the Ruby script is stopped.
                
                If the user selects OK, the path of the folder is returned as a string.
                If the user selects cancel and the hard\_wire\_cancel parameter is set

                Displays a graph according to the parameters passed in.
                
                The graph method contains 1 parameter, a hash.
                
                It has the following keys, which are all strings:
                
                WindowTitle – a string containing the title of the graph window
                
                GraphTitle – a string containing the title of the graph (i.e. this
                appears IN the window rather than being the title)
                
                XAxisLabel – a string containing the label of the X-axis
                
                YAxisLabel – a string containing the label of the Y-axis
                
                IsTime – a value which evaluates as true or false, which should be set
                to true if the x axis is made up of time values and is labelled as dates
                / times.
                
                Traces – an array of traces defined as follows:
                
                Each trace in the array of traces is in turn also a hash.
                
                The trace hash has the following keys, which are all strings:
                
                Title – a string giving the trace's name
                
                TraceColour – an integer containing an RGB value of the trace's colour.
                A convenient way of getting this is to use the WSApplicatioon.colour
                method
                
                SymbolColour - – an integer containing an RGB value of the colour used
                for the symbol used at the points along the trace. A convenient way of
                getting this is to use the WSApplicatioon.colour method
                
                Marker – a string containing the symbol to be used for the points along

                It is important to realise that this method does not cause the script to
                wait until the file is closed – it opens the view and then continues to
                the next item in the script.

                The layout parameter must be an array consisting of one array for each
                line to be displayed.
                
                The array for each line must contain between 2 and 9 values as follows:
                
                Index 0 – a string to display as a description of the value for the row
                
                Index 1 – a type of the value – one of the following strings:
                
                > NUMBER – a number

                Here is an example of a prompt exercising most of these options:

                When run, it looks like this:
                
                <img src="./media/image11.png" width="448" height="315" />
                
                As you can see, there are a number of lists (with the button for the
                pull down to the right), and a number of filenames (with a button
                showing ellipses to press to invoke the file or folder dialog).
                
                The read only values are showed greyed out, in this example the rows are
                ordered so they appear at the bottom of the grid.
                
                Notice that the date time values in the lists and for defaults are set
                using DateTime.new as described earlier in this document.
                
                If OK is hit without changing any values, it returns an array like this:

                The parameters are as follows:
                
                Title – the title of the displayed dialog.
                
                Layout – an array of arrays as described below.
                
                Hard-wire cancel – if this is set to true or nil, if the user hits
                cancel, the running of the Ruby script is interrupted.
                
                The layout parameter must be an array consisting of one array for each
                line to be displayed.
                
                The array for each line must contain 2 or 3 values as follows:
                
                Index 0 – a string to display as the description of the value for the
                row
                
                Index 1 – the value to be displayed as a Ruby value. If the value is a
                float or a double it will be displayed by using the Ruby to\_f method,
                otherwise the to\_s method will be used.
                
                Index 2 (optional) – a number of decimal places to be used between 0 and
                8 inclusive, this will be used for float and double values and ignored
                for any others.

                The purpose of this method is to generate a name for a new network based
                on a given network name, with the intention that the old name is the
                name of an existing network and the new name will be used as the name of
                a subsequently created network.
                
                The 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> parameters are Boolean parameters
                which control the precise naming convention used. If branch is false the
                names will be got by appending \#1 on the end if the name does not end
                in \# followed by a number, if it does end in a \# followed by a number
                the number will be incremented. If branch is true the same applies
                except that \_ is used as the special character instead of \#. If add is
                true then \#1 or \_1 will be appended to the name regardless of whether
                or not the name ends in \# or \_ followed by a number.

                Given a scripting type and a name, creates a new object with that name
                in the root of the database. For this to work it is necessary that the
                type be a legal object type that can go into the root of the database
                i.e. this type must be “Asset Group”,”Model Group” or “Master Group”.
                More may be added in the future.
                
                Likely exceptions thrown by this method are:
                
                unrecognised type – if the type is not a valid scripting type name
                
                invalid object type for the root of a database – if objects of this type
                cannot be placed in the root of the database
                
                an object of this type and name already exists in root of database – if
                an object with this type and name exists in the root of the database
                
                licence and/or permissions do not permit creation of a child of this
                type in the root of the database – if the object cannot be created in
                the root of the database for licence and/or permissions reasons e.g. an
                attempt to create an Asset Group when the user doe not have an InfoNet
                licence of some sort
                
                unable to create object – if the creation fails for some other reason

		###`new_run`
                
            `#### Syntax:
                
                ```ruby
                run=mo.new_run(name,network,commit_id,rainfalls_and_flow_surveys,scenarios,parameters)
                ```
                
            `#### Description:
                
                
                Creates a new run. The method must be called on a model group otherwise
                an exception will be thrown – 'new\_run : runs may only be created in
                model groups'.
                
                The method can take arrays as parameters for both the rainfalls and flow
                surveys and for the scenarios. In the same way that dropping multiple
                rainfall events and flow surveys into the drop target on the schedule
                run dialog and selecting multiple scenarios on it yield multiple
                simulations for a run, so calling this method with arrays of values and
                with synthetic rainfall events which have multiple parameters (singly or
                in an array) will yield multiple sims for the run.
                
                The 'run' method which actually runs simulations is a method of the
                individual sim objects below the run, which may easily be found by using
                the 'children' method of the WSModelObject created using this method.
                
                The parameters are as follows:
                
                > Name – the name of the new run. This must not already be in use in the
                > model group otherwise an exception will be thrown – 'new\_run : name
                > already in use'.
                >
                > Network – the network used for the run. The parameter must be the ID
                > of the network, its scripting path, or the WSNumbatNetworkObject (i.e.
                > the network object returned from a suitable call).
                >
                > Commit ID – the commit ID to be used for the run. This may either be
                > the integer commit ID or nil in which case the latest commit at time
                > the run is created will be used.
                
                Rainfalls and flow surveys – this may be:
                
                1.  nil – in this case the run will be a dry weather flow run
                
                2.  a WSModelObject which is a rainfall event or a flow survey
                
                3.  the scripting path of a rainfall event or a flow survey as a string
                
                4.  the ID of a rainfall event
                
                5.  a negative number equal to -1 times the ID of a flow survey e.g. -7
                    means the Flow Survey with ID 7.
                
                6.  An array. If the parameter is an array, then if the length of the
                    array is 0 then the event will be a dry weather flow run, otherwise
                    all the array elements must be one of 2 – 5 above. The array may not
                    contain duplicates otherwise an exception will be thrown.
                
                Scenarios – this may be:
                
                1.  nil – in this case the run will use the base scenario of the network
                
                2.  the name of a scenario
                
                3.  an array in which each element is the name of a scenario as
                    a string. It must not contain scenarios that do not exist
                    or duplicates.
                
                Parameters – this must be a hash containing parameters (see Appendix 2).
                
                Parameters for the run may either be set in this call.

                ```
                
            `#### Description:
                
                
                This method may only be used on runs. The following conditions must
                apply:
                
                1.  The 'Working' field must have been set to true
                
                2.  There must be no uncommented changes for the network for the run.
                
                3.  all scenarios which were included in the list of scenarios for which
                    the run was set up must be present and validates.
                
                This method has the same effect as pressing the 'update to latest
                version of network' button on the Run view in the user interface.

            `#### Description:
                
                
                Returns a WSOpenNetwork object corresponding to the model object,
                providing the model object is of a network type or a sim – see above for
                the description of the difference between a WSModelObject and a
                WSOpenNetwork.
                
                When this method is called on a sim, the network will be opened with the
                results of the simulation loaded into it. An exception will be thrown if
                the simulation did not succeed, the results are inaccessible or are not
                open.
                
                When you open the results of a simulation:
                
                -   The network is opened as read only
                
                -   The current scenario is set to the scenario used for the simulation
                
                -   The current scenario cannot be changed
                
                -   As with the behaviour in the UI of the software, the network with
                    the results loaded has a current timestep. The results start by
                    being opened at the first timestep (timestep 0) unless there are
                    only maximum results in which case they are opened as the maximum
                    results timestep.

                Exports the network data to GIS.
                
                The parameters are as follows:
                
                Format :
                
                This parameter must be one of the following:
                
                -   SHP – Shape file
                
                -   TAB – Tab file
                
                -   MIF – MIF file
                
                -   GDB – GeoDatabase
                
                Params:
                
                This parameter can either be a hash, described below, or nil. If the
                parameter is nil then the default values for its various options will be
                used.
                
                Folder:
                
                This parameter contains the base folder for the files to be exported,
                except for the GDB format where it is the name of the GeoDatabase.
                
                The params hash can contain a number of keys. If the hash is nil or the
                value is not specified the default behaviour applies as described below.
                
                ExportFlags – Boolean – if this is true then the flags are exported
                along with the data values, if false they aren't. The default is true.
                
                Feature Dataset – String – for GeoDatabases, the name of the feature
                dataset. The default is an empty string.
                
                SkipEmptyTables – Boolean – if true skips empty tables (even if they are
                listed in the value for the Tables key). The default is false.
                
                Tables – Array as described below – the default is to export results for
                all tables.
                
                UseArcGISCompatability – Boolean – this is the equivalent of selecting
                the check-box in the UI. The default is false i.e. the equivalent of not
                checking the check-box in the UI.
                
                The tables element of the hash must be an array of strings which must be
                names of tables as returned by the list\_GIS\_export\_tables. Duplicates
                and unrecognised values are not permitted.

                component.
                
                The ORACLE and SQLSERVER options require the relevant client software to
                be installed.
                
                The second parameter is the path of the CFG file, as saved from the Open

                Following these three parameters, there then follow a multiple of the
                'parameters per table' depending on data type, as show in the table
                above. It is possible to export data into more than one table by
                supplying a multiple of that number of parameters e.g. to export data
                from 3 tables into CSV files, six parameters are supplied for these
                bringing the total to 9 parameters. Alternatively, of course, it is
                possible to export the data by making three calls to the method.
                
                The parameters are as follows:
                
                In all cases the first parameter is the name of the table to export. In
                this context the name is as displayed in the software's user interface
                in the Open Data Export Centre with any spaces removed. E.g. Node,
                CCTVSurvey. This differs from the convention used elsewhere e.g. for
                SQL.
                
                For CSV, TSV, MIF, TAB and Shape files the second parameter is the path
                of the file to export.
                
                For Access databases (MDB) the parameters are as described below:
                
                1.  Table to export
                
                2.  Name of table in Access database
                
                3.  File name of Access database
                
                For XML the parameters are as follows:

                2.  'Feature class' (as it is called in the UI – i.e. the name of the
                    root element)
                
                3.  'Feature dataset' (as it is called in the UI- i.e. the name used for
                    each data element)
                
                4.  XML file name.
                
                For GeoDatabase the parameters are as follows:

                    must exist.
                
                5.  ArcSDE configuration keyword – nil for Personal / File GeoDatabases,
                    and ignored for updates
                
                6.  Filename (for personal and file GeoDatabases, connection name
                    for SDE)
                
                For Oracle the parameters are as follows:
                
                1.  Table to export
                
                2.  Table name in Oracle
                
                3.  Table owner
                
                4.  Update – true to update, false otherwise. If true the table
                    must exist.
                
                5.  User name
                
                6.  Password
                
                7.  Connection string
                
                For SQL Server the parameters are as follows:
                
                1.  Table to export
                
                2.  Table name in SQL Server
                
                3.  Server name
                
                4.  Instance name
                
                5.  Database name
                
                6.  Update – true to update, false otherwise

                This method imports and updates network data using a previously set up
                Open Data Import Centre configuration.
                
                Unlike the WSOpenNetwork version, it returns nil.
                
                The number of parameters for this method is variable and depends on the
                type of data imported (determined by the first parameter) and the number
                of imports set up in one call to the method, which can be more then one.
                
                The first parameter can be one of the table below. Depending on that
                value, the number of parameters per table is as shown in the table:
                
                | **Format** | **Meaning**                                                 | **Parameters per table** |

                copy of an ESRI server or desktop product.
                
                The ORACLE and SQLSERVER options require the relevant client software to
                be installed.
                
                The second parameter is the path of the CFG file, as saved from the Open
                Data Import Centre user interface. It can contain the mappings for more
                than one table.
                
                The third parameter must be nil or a hash containing the options, which
                broadly correspond to those in the Open Data Import Centre user
                interface as follows:

                Following these three parameters, there then follow a multiple of the
                'parameters per table' depending on data type, as show in the table
                above. It is possible to import data into more than one table, or data
                into one table from more than one source by supplying a multiple of that
                number of parameters e.g. to import data into 3 tables from CSV files,
                six parameters are supplied for these bringing the total to 9
                parameters. Alternatively, of course, it is possible to import the data
                by making three calls to the method.
                
                All these parameters are strings with the exception of one parameter for
                SQL Server, which is the sixth out of eight parameters and is a Boolean
                which is described below.
                
                The parameters are as follows:
                
                In all cases the first parameter is the name of the table to import. In
                this context the name is as displayed in the software's user interface
                in the Open Data Import Centre with any spaces removed. E.g. Node,
                CCTVSurvey. This differs from the convention used elsewhere e.g. for
                SQL.
                
                For subtables the name is the name of the table, followed by the name of
                the subtable without any spaces e.g. to import the Details from the CCTV
                Survey, the string should be CCTVSurveyDetails.
                
                For CSV, TSV and Shape files the second parameter is the path of the
                file to import.
                
                For Access databases the second parameter is the path of the Access
                database and the third parameter is the name of the table or stored
                query to import. Data can be imported on the basis of SQL queries by
                adding an SQL query to the database, however an SQL expression cannot be
                used in this parameter.
                
                For GeoDatabases the second parameter is the name of the feature class
                to import from and the third parameter is the path of the GeoDatabase.
                
                For Oracle the parameters are as follows:
                
                > 1 – the table name to import into as described above
                >
                > 2 – the table name in the Oracle database
                >
                > 3 – the connection string e.g. '//power:/orcl'
                >
                > 4 – the owner of the Oracle table being imported from
                >
                > 5 – the oracle user name
                >
                > 6 – the oracle password
                
                For SQL server the parameters are as follows:
                
                > 1– the table name to import into as described above
                >
                > 2 – the table name in SQL Server
                >
                > 3 – the server name
                >
                > 4 – the SQL Server instance name
                >
                > 5 – the database name
                >
                > 6 – integrated security (Boolean – true or false, true meaning
                > integrated security)
                >
                > 7 – user name (for non-integrated security, nil otherwise)
                >
                > 8- password (for non-integrated security, nil otherwise)

                The names '\_nodes' or '\_links' can be used to run the SQL over all
                node or link tables in the same way as can be achieved by selecting 'All
                nodes' or 'All links' in the dropdowns in the SQL dialog.
                
                The SQL query can include multiple clauses in the same was as SQL run
                from the user interface, and can use any of the options that do not open
                results or prompt grids e.g.

    ## WSSimObject
        
        An object of this type represents a Sim object, a Risk Analysis Results
        object or a Risk Analysis Sim object. The Risk Analysis Results objects
        contain the results for a number of return periods and summary results.
        The Risk Analysis Sim objects contain only summary results.
        
        The different return periods for the Risk Analysis Results objects
        correspond to the timesteps for 'normal' simulations. The names of the
        methods reflect the usage for 'normal' simulations i.e. to list the
        return periods for a risk analysis results object you should use the
        list\_timesteps method.
        
        Various methods cannot be called for the Risk Analysis Sim objects if
        those methods are not relevant for sims with only summary results.

                Exports simulation results to GIS.  
                The parameters are as follows:
                
                Format
                
                This parameter must be one of the following:
                
                -   SHP – Shape file
                
                -   TAB – Tab file
                
                -   MIF – MIF file
                
                -   GDB – GeoDatabase
                
                Timesteps:
                
                The timesteps parameter may take a number of values of different types
                as follows:
                
                -   nil – if the parameter is nil this is the equivalent of the 'None'
                    option when selecting timesteps in the UI i.e. it only makes sense
                    if the appropriate option in the params parameter hash is set so
                    that maximum results are exported for the simulation.
                
                -   'All' – if the parameter is set to the string 'All' then all
                    timesteps will be exported (this does not include the maximum
                    results – if these are wanted then the appropriate parameter in the
                    params hash should be set)
                
                -   'Max' – if the parameter is set to the string 'Max' then the maximum
                    results will be exported. This can also be achieved by setting the
                    appropriate value in the params hash.
                
                -   An integer ('Fixnum') representing a timestep with 0 representing
                    the first timestep. The number of timesteps may be found via the
                    timestep\_count method or by counting the number of timesteps in the
                    result of the list\_timesteps method. The maximum value permitted is
                    the number of timesteps minus 1.
                
                -   An array of integers representing the timesteps as described above.
                    The values must all be valid and it may not contain duplicates. This
                    can be used to flexibly choose which timesteps to export in a
                    similar manner to the more complex UI options.
                
                Params:
                
                This parameter can either be a hash, described below, or nil. If the
                parameter is nil then the default values for its various options will be
                used.
                
                Folder:
                
                This parameter contains the base folder for the files to be exported,
                except for the GDB format where it is the name of the GeoDatabase.
                
                The params hash can contain a number of keys. If the hash is nil or the
                value is not specified the default behaviour applies as described below.
                
                2DZoneSQL – Array as described below – the default is not to export any
                extra fields for 2D elements.
                
                AlternativeNaming – Boolean – if this is set then the subfolders /
                feature datasets used for the export are given simpler but less
                attractive names which may be helpful if the aim is process the files
                with software rather than to have a user select and open them in a GIS
                package. The simple names are &lt;model object id&gt;\_&lt;timestep&gt;
                with the timesteps numbered from zero as with the timesteps parameter of
                the method and with &lt;model object id&gt;\_Max for the maxima. The
                default is to use the same naming convention as the UI.
                
                ExportMaxima – Boolean – if this is set to true the maximum results are
                exported. The default is false i.e. to not export them.
                
                Feature Dataset – String – for GeoDatabases, the name of the feature
                dataset. The default is an empty string.
                
                Tables – Array as described below – the default is to export results for
                all tables.
                
                Threshold – Double – the depth threshold below which a 2D element is not
                exported. This is the equivalent of checking the check-box in the UI and
                entering a value. The default is to behave as though the check-box is
                unchecked i.e. all elements are exported.
                
                UseArcGISCompatability – Boolean – this is the equivalent of selecting
                the check-box in the UI. The default is false i.e. the equivalent of not
                checking the check-box in the UI.
                
                The tables element of the hash must be an array of strings which must be
                names of tables as returned by the list\_results\_GIS\_exports\_table.
                Duplicates and unrecognised values are not permitted.
                
                The 2DZoneSQL element of the hash must be an array of arrays. Each of
                those arrays must in turn contain 2 or 3 values.
                
                The first value is the name of the field to be exported as a string.
                
                The second value is the SQL expression as a string.
                
                The optional 3<sup>rd</sup> value must be an integer between 0 and 9
                inclusive representing the number of decimal places. If this is not set
                then a default of 2 decimal places is used.

                Runs the inference object on the network, which must be a collection
                asset network or a distribution asset network.
                
                The parameters are as follows:
                
                Inference – the inference to be run –may be a WSModelObject, an object
                path or the numerical ID of the model object. This must be of the
                appropriate inference object type for the network.
                
                Ground\_model – optional ground model (used for inferring heigh). May be
                a WSModelObject, an object path or the numerical ID of the model object.
                The WSModelObject or path may be of a TIN ground model or a grid ground
                model, the numerical ID may only be that of a grid ground model i.e. to
                use a TIN ground model you must use a WSModelObject or path.
                
                Mode – the mode of the inference, corresponding to the options on the
                dialog shown when inference is run in the user interface. The permitted
                values are as follows:
                
                -   nil, false or the string 'Network' – run the inference on the whole
                    network
                
                -   true or the string 'Selection' – run the inference on the current
                    selection (which, of course, must be set up within the script)
                
                -   the string 'Zone' – run the inference for the zone specified in the
                    following parameter.
                
                -   The string 'Category' – run the inference for zones with the zone
                    specified in the following parameter.
                
                Zone\_or\_zone\_category – a string representing the zone or zone
                category. This parameter is only used if the previous parameter is
                'Zone' or 'Category'.
                
                Error\_file – if this is a string, then error messages are written to
                the file named (which is deleted prior to the method being run)
                
                When run within the UI, the ground model parameter must be nil. If there
                is a ground model loaded into the network (either TIN or grid), it will
                be used instead.

    ## WSRowObject
        
        The WSRowObject class is instantiated from various methods within the Ruby API.
        Each row object instantiated contains a copy of the data for the specific row
        it was instantiated from. It is important to note that the fields in this object
        ARE NOT POINTERS to the database fields. These are by-value copies of the field's
        data. To make changes to the database fields the `write` method must be called.
        When the `write` method is called, ICM will loop over all fields in the `WSRowObject`
        instance and write them to the database. As a byproduct of this behaviour each
        object you pull from the database obtains the current data from the database,
        for example:
        
        ```ruby
        net = WSApplication.current_network
        #Get the first object
        net.each do |obj|
            obj.notes = "hello world"
            newObj = net.row_object_by_type_and_id(obj.table_info.name,obj.id)
            puts newObj.notes #=> NOT "hello world"
            break
        end
        ```
        
        Fields prefixed with `_` will not be written to the database when calling
        the write method. E.G.
        
        ```ruby
        net = WSApplication.current_network
        net.transaction_begin
            net.each do |obj|
            obj.user_text_10 = "Written to database"
            obj._user_text_10 = "Not written to the database"
            obj.write
            end
        net.transaction_commit
        ```
        
        Typically most ruby interpreters signify this as an 'unused' variable, however,
        in ICM, you can use it to temporarily store information which you may not want to
        write to the database.

                The navigate and navigate1 methods are used to navigate between objects
                and other objects to which they are physically related.
                
                The navigate method may be used to navigate using one-to-one and
                one-to-many links and returns an array of WSRowObject objects. The
                navigate1 method may only be used to navigate using one-to-one links and
                returns a WSRowObject or nil if there is no object related to the object
                by that particular navigation type.
                
                The navigation types are the same as those used within the SQL in the
                software as follows:
