# ICM External Library

This library is built in the programming language AHK (Autohotkey) using the accessibility API provided by Microsoft [MSAA](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd373592(v=vs.85).aspx).

## Vision

* To implement all features accessible to users within ICM using UI automation principles or otherwise.
* To implement stable features that users can rely upon.
* To be able to handle multiple instances of ICM, allowing users to 'multithread' tasks on their computer, further speeding up processing using ICM's standard application.
* To produce a robust library which will not break in future updates.
* To integrate the system with ICM exchange both in the UI and in the external application, allowing anyone to make external applications which interop with ICM, further increasing usability and user interaction with users.

## Motivation

Not all features are integrated into ICM exchange and as long as the ICMExchange language is closed source progression will remain slow. Those in the water industry need an alternative to automate their systems and they need it now. This open source library will be able to help those who need to automate their ICM workflows and without having to wait for Innovyze to integrate features into ICMExchange.

## About the creator

My name is James Warren. I am a Theoretical Physics graduate from the University of Sussex. I started work in the Hydraulic Modelling industry in 2015 and have spent this time automating systems in MapBasic, AHK and Ruby. However automation is not my job so this library and libraries like them have been entirely written in my own time at night, mostly for the fun of it! Perhaps someone who's job is more in line with automation in the Hydraulic Modelling industry, will take up this library and improve it further.
